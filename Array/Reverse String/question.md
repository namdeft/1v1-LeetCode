# 344. Reverse String

# Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s``.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

</pre>

Constraints:

-   `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
-   `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.
