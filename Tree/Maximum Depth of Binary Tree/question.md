# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

# Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
</pre>

Constraints:

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range
-   `[0, 104]`. -`100 <= Node.val <= 100`
